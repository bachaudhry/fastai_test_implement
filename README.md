# fastai_test_implement
My go to repo for the fastai library. Understanding the mechanics behind the lessons with some experimentation of my own.

**`NOTE`** This repo is my personal "code-along" set of exercises in order to gain a deeper understanding of the awesome fastai library. Every line of code is either taken from, or inspired by, Jeremy Howard's Deep Learning lecture series.
